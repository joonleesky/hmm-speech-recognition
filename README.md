Speech Recognition with Viterbi-Decoding
===============

Implementation of **Viterbi decoding** for the number recognition<br><br>

* Transition probabilty was pre-trained by **Baum-Welch algorithm**
* Observation probability is defined by **Gaussian Mixture Model**
* Transition probability within words was defined by **unigram and bigram** probability.

<br><br>**Results**<br>

99.88% accuracy in words and 96.38% accuracy in sentences.<br><br>
